# Simplifying S3 Data Ingestion and Filtering using Python and PySpark

In today's data-driven world, efficiently ingesting and processing data from various sources is crucial. One of the most popular and widely used cloud storage solutions is Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), which offers scalable storage and easy access to your data. However, managing the process of reading and filtering data from S3 can become complex, especially when dealing with large datasets or needing to track the progress of data processing. In this repository, we introduce you to a Python code snippet that simplifies this process using the AWS Glue framework. Let's explore how this code works and how you can leverage it for your data processing needs.

## Introduction

The heart of our solution is the `ReadS3Uri` class. This class encapsulates various functionalities required for reading data from S3, applying custom filters, and managing bookmarks to track your data ingestion progress. Let's break down the important components and steps for using this class effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started, create an instance of the `ReadS3Uri` class by providing several parameters. These parameters include the S3 base URI, bookmark settings, AWS access credentials, and more. Once initialized, you're ready to start reading and filtering data.

## Usage

The primary method you'll use is the `handler` method. This method orchestrates the steps of listing files and metadata, applying custom filters, managing bookmarks, and returning filtered S3 URIs. Whether you're dealing with frequent data updates, large datasets, or the need for incremental processing, this code can significantly streamline your workflow.

## Bookmark Management

Managing bookmarks is a powerful feature of the `ReadS3Uri` class. By enabling bookmarks, you ensure that your data processing is incremental and efficient. The class automatically tracks the last read position and saves it to an S3 location of your choice. This prevents you from processing the same data multiple times.

## Custom URI Filter

The class includes a method named `custom_uri_filter` that enables you to apply a custom filter to the list of file paths. This is particularly helpful when you want to include or exclude files based on specific conditions.

## Conclusion

In this repository, we've introduced you to a powerful Python code snippet that simplifies the process of ingesting and filtering data from Amazon S3 using the AWS Glue framework. By encapsulating the necessary functionalities within the `ReadS3Uri` class, the code offers an elegant and efficient solution for managing data processing tasks. Whether you're dealing with frequent data updates, large datasets, or the need for incremental processing, this code can significantly streamline your workflow.

Remember that while we've provided an overview of how to use the code, you can further customize and extend it to suit your specific requirements. By leveraging the capabilities of the AWS Glue framework, you can unlock the potential to process, transform, and analyze your data effectively. Happy data processing!
